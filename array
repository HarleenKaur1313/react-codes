ðŸ˜ƒcreate an array of books and print them in list form
<?php 
    $books= ["book1", "book2", "book3"];

    foreach ($books as $book){
      echo "<li> $book </li>";
    }
    ?>

ðŸ˜Šwhenever we need to build complex html fragments within php -->

    <?php foreach ($books as $book) :?>  <!--instead of {} we can use : and end using endforeach -->
      <div> 
        <li> hello</li> 
      </div>
    <?php endforeach ?>

âœŒanother syntac for echoing out things (just skip php and echo word particularly and insert = sign)
        <?= $book ?>
        <!-- <?php echo $book ?>  -->
